## Conclusion
* Sometimes, the basics suffice. Don't spend too much time trying to perfect something.
    * Not an excuse to slack off, set your eyes on the prize (beyond MVP)
* Even if you don't finish something on time, especially if you're disappointed, keep pushing. Keep learning more to try and improve what your past self might have missed.
* Time is money, and time is the one thing you can't get back. Don't push deadlines, because the future is sometimes unpredictable.
