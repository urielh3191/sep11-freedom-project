# SEP11 Freedom Project
 by **Uriel "Luis" Hernandez Juarez**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **vue.js** in order to help me make a **digital dashboard at a glance**.
