# Entry 3 (Presentation and SEP Expo) | 06/01/2025

## Content: 
After completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) rendition of my project (late by a month, mind you), it was time to present my Freedom Project to my class using slides. Now, because I had been so busy with getting the MVP finished, I had to also rush the slides. So now I had a project that I was unhappy with, and slides that were also very ugly and had just barely enough information about my project to be considered “informative”. Here's the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14FONPfXQjYcgJS7oMwjDGHwwHREF7zywOIUEdxERbAk/edit?usp=sharing).

In the presentation form we submitted, I chose to present to my class in 5th place (last place). Therefore, every day for class, I would be sitting in suspense, wondering if I would be next. In addition to that uncertainty, I had to be absent for some days for tests, so I was also scared that I might miss my presentation, which would have a HUGE negative impact on my class grade. So needless to say, I was extremely nervous while presenting, trying to both balance my composure and keeping a smooth flow while presenting.

To combat this, I had rehearsed a couple times at home in preparation for my actual presentation, but I kept stopping because I had issues with going over the time limit (think 10min - 15min), and not presenting coherently. In some practice sessions, I had spoken clearly and not in a huge mess, but I took too much time – I was sure to lose the audience's attention– . And when I had made the presentation brief, I spoke so quickly or would go on incomprehensible tangents that led nowhere. 

The day of the SEP Expo, I brought my laptop and project upstairs, ready to present to anyone who came. Nobody really came, but the very few 2 or 3 that did come made me realize some small mistakes in my presentation slides that I overlooked, which I then changed, or my presentation style. This was awesome, because this gave me real-time feedback to work off of. And when the SEP judges came, I noticed they took a little longer on my project, and they gave me no criticisms of my presentation or project (good sign).

However, the day of the actual presentation (May 28th, 2025), the process went a lot smoother in person. In addition to the feedback from the SEP Expo yesterday, I had come up with the presentation plan the night before and practiced in my head, which helped me keep a fair cadence while conveying the concepts of my project to the audience. And this practice I believe is what led me to getting a 9/10 on the presentation! Because I submitted my presentation slides late, I got docked 1 point. But in the end, I was very happy with how it all turned out.

# Engineering process:
For the slides, I made them in PowerPoint. The slides were in stage 7 and 8, where I would show the planned beyond MVP, and the current MVP, and then just as I thought I had the slides finished and finished step 8 of the EDP process, I went back to stage 7 (Improve as needed) where I would fix errors with the flow of the slides, maybe add a few images, etc, and go back to stage 8 (Communicate the results). Then, the SEP Expo occurred, where students came to see our projects. After receiving feedback from visitors, I revisited my slides to update them to make them even better. I believe this also helped my presentation in class (I presented after the SEP Expo to my class). This mainly positive feedback of my slides and project helped me realize that it’s not as bad as I think it is. And this constant back and forth, while annoying, led me to create a much better presentation and project, as I was able to directly work off of external opinions.

# Skills:
## • Problem decomposition and debugging
During this project, many errors discouraged me from being able to execute code correctly. However, painstaking review of each section of relevant code led me often to finding a careless mistake was breaking the whole website, or a missing argument in the code. This constant perseverance of trial and error led to my final project being finished on time without major bugs.

## • Attention to detail
All throughout the school year, as I slowly developed little bits of code, I always felt the need to make sure that the website layout and design was as sleek and professional as possible. This is a source of pride for my project, and can be applied in the real world in many ways, and making sure that I have something that I can be proud to put my name on is crucial to any project. However, at many points along the timeline, my insatiable desire to force a beyond MVP projects concept when I barely even had a MVP made my brain lock up, unsure of how to proceed. However, this leads me on to:

## • Embracing failure
For example, I would want to start coding a Vue app that would download the train arrival times from the MTA GTFS-RT API, when I had only just gotten the weather information app to work. Eventually, I learned to work on the absolute minimum first, then add on later. Even if it means having to break down the code to add something in later, it’ll be better than having nothing to present. 

# To sum it all up: 
My Freedom Project was finished. Even though I think it's terrible since it's not what I wanted it to be, my classmates and SEP judges made me realize that – since I pushed myself to create a product that works – it's actually not bad for a webpage that does most of what the MVP was set to do. My lessons to myself are:
* better time management
* stop procrastinating
* sketch up a plan !!
* don't be so hard on yourself.

It's miles easier to ride a skateboard than to drive the chassis and wheels of a unfinished car.
